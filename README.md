# DADS - Decentralized Anonymous Data System

Exercise your right to privacy without sacrificing modern-day digital comfort.

## Why

Article 12 of the [UN human rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) states:

> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with ~his~ _their_ privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

We believe that nowadays the right to privacy is heavily infringed upon by companies that have an interest in advertising and entertainment. According to some sources, these companies can predict your behaviour better than people that are closest to you by analizing the data that is collected while the service is used.

We do, however, realize that heavy data colection is also beneficial to users. Only with a good understanding of the user, services like TikTok or Pinterest, along with many others, are possible, and we relize that no one will agree to stop invasive data collection at the cost of modern-day digital comfort.

On top of that, even if a global ban of any sort of data colelction was issued, we do not trust any individual entity to comply. A legal ban would only encourage collecting data in secret to come out on top of the competition.

## How

DADS offers a solution that protects digital privacy and makes it impossible to collect identifiable user data without preventing the digital comforts we are used to. DADS is designed to work in a world where no data about any person is allowed to be stored non-publically. To store data privately a DADS Vault must be used and to anonymize the connection between a user and a server DADS mixer (technology similar to TOR) should be used.
